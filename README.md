## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Enzo, and Iâ€™m a young professional on a journey of continuous learning. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development and working as a Computer Operator at ICOMON.
Here on GitHub, youâ€™ll find some of my projects, including academic work and personal initiatives. I work with technologies like PHP, HTML, CSS, JSON, JavaScript, and some Python. One of my recent projects is a content aggregator website about Naruto, where users can interact and contribute information â€” one of my first hands-on web development experiences.

My skills include:
Advanced proficiency in the Microsoft Office Suite.
Web development with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Data handling using JSON.
Basic knowledge of Python for automation and development.
Advanced English skills, enabling me to easily read and understand technical documentation.
Iâ€™m always looking to learn new technologies, solve problems independently, and contribute practical solutions. My goal is to grow as a developer and professional, collaborating on projects that make an impact.

Letâ€™s connect!
If you have suggestions, want to collaborate, or just want to share ideas, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m eager to learn from other professionals and explore new opportunities. Thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ˜Š
